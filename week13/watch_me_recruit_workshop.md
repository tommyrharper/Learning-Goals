# Watch me recruit

1. Scheduling the time for the job hunt.

2. Document your job hunt - preferably huntr so you can show Makers.

3. Interesting companies that are not hiring.

4. Research - Find your top 50 companies.

 - 50 compaines that you'd love to work for.
 - 50 companies you should work for.
 - 50 companies you should never work for.

Goal apply to the tcompaines you'd love to work for first.
Then reapply to them every other month.

## Companies you should work for vs never work for

### Great Training and culture ----> glassdoor

Have they hired boot camp students before?
Have those bootcamp students stayed?
Have those bootcamp students progressed?

### They hire great developers, or make greate developers ----> LinkedIN

Where have their engineering team come from?

Where have their engineering team gone to?

### The technology you want to learn ----> stackshare

What technology and why?

Coa you join using say the front end, then move into the backend.

### Daily prep

1 to Start = 1 Company per day => 5 Companies per week => 20 Companies per month
2 is Great = 2 Companies per day => 10 Companies per week => 40 per month
3 is Ideal = 3 Companies per day => 15 Companies per week => 60 Companies per month

Every day go to your list and pick your companies for that day.

With you templates, you'll be creating:

1. Your Cover Letter (Changing only the section on Why you want to work for them).

2. Your LinkedIN Connection Messages

3. If you need it, a Longer Direct Email or LinkedIN Message.

Then go onto Linked and send them a message asking for feedback. You want to build a relationship with an engineering team. Basically the same message, different name.

Search on LinkedIN - 
(developer OR engineer OR engineering OR hiring OR recruiter OR HR OR CTO OR CEO) at tray.io, filter UK and London. Send the message to everyone. No one is too senior.

You come across the director of engineering - send him a longer direct message.

NEVER GET THE NAME WRONG.

Use notes everywhere , to leave sticky notes on the website pages, saying applied, sent message on this date.

If they don't come back to you, send a longer message. Spreadsheet follow up.

Go to the contact list e.g. info@qubit.io

Then Direct email

And can then send it to every single person on LinkedIN to.

### Direct email -> Have one prepared.

Keep it simple no fluff.

Why I would like to join you, and what I can bring to your team. Ask for feedback.

### How to get your phone number removed

In accordance with GDPR I want it removed, I want it purged and if you don't do that you can be fined £100k.

## Judging glass door

If it is an anonynous employee it might not be a real review. Some companies will force their employees to leave glassdoor reviews.

Look for reviews that are done very close together.

Four or five negative reviews are a big warning sign. One could be the employee.

You can send the people a message who have left the company.

Search past companies on LinkendIN, contact them, have a phone call.

Note companies cultures can change within 6 or so months
