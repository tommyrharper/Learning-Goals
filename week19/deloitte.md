DM Will to ask where they are at with Deloitte taking on some Makers.

Risk analysis and audit, management consulting.

Deloitte digital is now a brand, the jobs are at Deloitte.

You are both a software engineer and a consultant.

You are working for clients outside of Deloitte.

The kind of work you are doing is not reliable. It could change the kind of work, who you are working with and what your responsibilites are, are not a given when you got to Deloitte.

If you really like the idea of staying in one team in one tech that might happen at Deloitte, but it's not a garuantee.

20,000 employess in the UK, 100,000s around the world. One of the most successful companies in the world, 100s of years old.

Am I type of person Deloitte wants to hire? Do I exhibit the certain types of behaviour they like?

They expect that you are in charge, they expect that you are going to take the iniatitive, and find people if you get stuck.

So the support is not given to you, you are not given a mentor, if you want training/a promotion you have to make it happen for yourself.

If it sounds appealing to you, then the amount of opportunity that is available is massive. You will get hugely rewarded for it, you can get senior very quickly.

2 tracks - technical specialist/manager routes.

Tech consulting firm do all of the software engineering.

There are many locations. Bristol, Manchester, Edinborough, Belfast, all around the world.

If you are not willing to travel at all, it will be hard to work at Deloitte.

Can't promise that they won't make you travel.

You have an extra layer of support at Makers.

Deloitte do software engineering better than any other professional services firm.

Deloitte and Thoughtworks are the best places to do tech consulting.

When you are travelling, they will pay for everything.
