# Deloitte talk

Will Bentick is the speaker.

November 2014 is when he joined Deloitte.

They have hired 84 people from Makers -> Includes people that Deloitte sent to Makers.

Will talk about positives/negatives.

DM Will to ask where they are at with Deloitte taking on some Makers.

Risk analysis and audit, management consulting.

Deloitte digital is now a brand, the jobs are at Deloitte.

You are both a software engineer and a consultant.

You are working for clients outside of Deloitte.

The kind of work you are doing is not reliable. It could change the kind of work, who you are working with and what your responsibilites are, are not a given when you got to Deloitte.

If you really like the idea of staying in one team in one tech that might happen at Deloitte, but it's not a garuantee.

20,000 employess in the UK, 100,000s around the world. One of the most successful companies in the world, 100s of years old.

Am I type of person Deloitte wants to hire? Do I exhibit the certain types of behaviour they like?

They expect that you are in charge, they expect that you are going to take the iniatitive, and find people if you get stuck.

So the support is not given to you, you are not given a mentor, if you want training/a promotion you have to make it happen for yourself.

If it sounds appealing to you, then the amount of opportunity that is available is massive. You will get hugely rewarded for it, you can get senior very quickly.

2 tracks - technical specialist/manager routes.

Tech consulting firm do all of the software engineering.

There are many locations. Bristol, Manchester, Edinborough, Belfast, all around the world.

If you are not willing to travel at all, it will be hard to work at Deloitte.

Can't promise that they won't make you travel.

You have an extra layer of support at Makers.

Deloitte do software engineering better than any other professional services firm.

Deloitte and Thoughtworks are the best places to do tech consulting.

When you are travelling, they will pay for everything.

It's not just about being proactive and taking the iniatitive, it's also about your ability to deal with clients. They also place great value on your having a clear vision of your career trajectory.

1 year you are a contractor for Makers, then Deloitte employ you.

Will Bentick knows exactly the kind of people that Deloitte are after. Trust him.

There are no tech specifics. They are not looking for you to be good at X. They are looking at you to be a Maker. To be invested in their future. Advocating for pair programming. Being engaged in best practices and advocating for them.

They want you to contribute. They use Java more than anything else, it's not really going to make any difference. They don't care what your tech skills are as much.

One of the great things about Deloitte is you can move onto something else if you don't like what you are doing.

It's more important that you are able to clearly and articulately talk about your career trajectory.

## Roles

Most work is app development.
Cloud and platform roles.
Docker and kubernetes.
Quality Engineering -> QA/testing.
DevOps.

There are some specialist roles -> SalesForce Engineering. This is maturing.
More distant: skala based data analysis in the risk part of the company.

## Hiring process

Makers are always trying to get the most people hired at Deloitte.

There may or may not be a tech test.

Each part of the company will have a different interview process.

We don't know if all of those roles will go through Makers.

Start days for these roles won't be until September.

They do lots of background checks.

### Questions

What sort of support is there for Junior Developers at Deloitte.

Why have you stayed at Deloitte for 6 years? What do you love about Deloitte?

### How to stand out from the crowd

Be yourself. Be authentic. Be true to yourself. Behave as you would behave in the job. The number of people who will be successful at Deloitte is a lot larger than the number of roles that will be available.

Unlikely they will hire more than 5 people.
