# Day 1

This is the tech test/code quality week, composed of mainly solo work.

Keep going over the first tech test until it is awesome! 

Today I completed my bank-tech-test project!

Phew, that was amazing! I really got in the zone! Awesome. It's 9pm and I just finished, the time flew by!

Great to be back using ruby.

I really improved my documentation skills today. I now have a framework and a formula to use to ensure my documentation is tip top! Fantastic. I will reach the top of the group soon if I continue like this (well I won't beat Harry, but he has more experience than me so that is virtually impossible, I can use him as inspiration though).
