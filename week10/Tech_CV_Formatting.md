## Notes

You're invited to talk about what you've done before, and make it painfully obvious to tech.

Can focus largely on Makers Academy.

There is no cover with a GitHub CV.

When we finish will do an MVP of our makers CV

Build a website.

Put most important stuff at the top.

Talk about automating Bitcoin transactions.

If you've done a degree, put that at the top.

Put the best stuff at the top.

Use hyperlinks.

Put blog at the top and keep linking to it.

Keep the bits in that I want you to remember at the top.

Always share your cool project that you're working on a the top. What is interesting about you? Don't worry about it being super polished.

Hiring managers say they expect to see 3-5 projects. Nikhil broke those rules and got a job really quickly - he made loads of projects.

Passion, drive and excitement for learing you're getting hired for.

Evidence is stronger than words.

Put projects and tech experience on your pdf CV.

Watch out on rating yourself on different things - like 'Expert' ruby, could invite some awkward questions from an expert ruby developer.

User projects you can enjoy talking about.

Go to meetups. Volunteer on open source projects.

Share that you are a mentor.

Skills section is more for softskills. Can include problem solving.

Ask the question so what? If you say you really like solving problems, so what?

Ask cohort what they love about you.

Ask your family what they love about me.

Go back to uni degree or most recent education.

Shorter and more concise is better. Say what you want to say in as few words as possible.

If you have a story that you can't explain in your CV, blog about it.

Being objective about yourself is really difficult.

Challenge each other and work in pairs to look at something objectively.

Unfinished projects are to be applauded.

I made a cryptocurrency tech meetup.

Even old crap project - show that on your CV!!!

Talk about your bitcoin code project.

Do reflective exercises, and log how you came over challenges.
