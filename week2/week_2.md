# Week 2
A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards my goals.

## Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Challenges

- Afternoons - Oystercard
- Weekend - Takeaway

# Day 2

Toady my goal is to learn to use and use unit test classes in isolation using mocking.

1. Read about doubles - 20 mins - COMPLETE

    - I now have a vague idea what they are but know I need to apply to deepen my undertanding.

2. Practice using it in some simple test cases and do the birthdays [exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/birthdays) - 1hr

3. Explain doubles to someone else - 5 mins - COMPLETE

    - I was not able to communicate the idea very clearly. This revealed the depth of my lack of understanding.

# Day 3

Toady my goal is to eview another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

1. Send my process workshop to video to a coach to get feedback. - 40 mins - COMPLETE

    - I learnt that I need to start by writing a simple domain model and input/output table.
    - I must simplify my approach and not add unnecessary features.
    - As soon as I notice something is redundant I should remove it.
    - Start with the simplest test.

2. Do the dependency injectiion practical [exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/dependency_injection.md) - 1hr - HALF COMPLETE

    - I have a slightly better idea how this works than yesterday but still not full comprehension

3. Review someones code and give them meaningful feedback - 30 mins - COMPLETE

    - I did this today in the process workshop, and was able to help someone improve their process.

# Day 4

Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.

1. Reconfigure my laptop after the system update to a new OS - 30 mins - COMPLETE

    - It is now working once again. Yay!

2. Look over the process worksheet and drill each step. - 30 mins - COMPLETE

    - I am now more certain how my process should look and have a clearer step by step progress.

3. Use that process to break one class into two classes that work together while maintaining test coverage with my pair. - 2hrs - COMPLETE

    - We really learnt to communicate with one another better and make sure we each understand what each other were doing, this made for a very harmonious pair programming experience.

# Day 5

1. Do a process review with my coach - 40 mins

2. Finish the dependency injectiion practical [exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/dependency_injection.md) - 1hr

3. Talk to my mentor - 20 mins
