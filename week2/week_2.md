A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards my goals.

## Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
