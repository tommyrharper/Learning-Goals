# Object-oriented programming

## Core concept - Objects

 - An object can contain data.
 - This data comes in the form of fields, eg. name, gender, hair colour.
 - This data can come in the form of procedures(or methods). e.g. a window objected may have the methods 'open' and 'close'.
 - Objects often access and modify the data fields within themselves.
 - Hence objects have a notion of "this" or "self".

 In OOP, we design computer programs by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

### Classes

In ruby we use classes to create objects.<br/>
We can then call the class with 'Class.new' to create an object which is an instance of that class.

### Benefits of OOP

OOP ensure that our code is reusable and maintable

## Single Responsibility principle

- Each object has only one responsibility.
- If a method is more than 10 lines long, that is a clue that it is breaking the single responsibility principle, and should be split up into smaller methods.

## Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is when you place an object within an object. 
- This is helpful as data can be hidden within an object such as a class.
- This means the data is not accessible to the outside world.
- Only functions which are within the class can access this data.
