# Day 3

Yesterday I learned about debugging, rspec testing and pair programming skills

I plan to:

Setup and Improve my goal setting system

1. Start a new repository on Github - 10 mins - COMPLETE

This helped me become more familiar with the use markdown.

2. Research and study other peoples notes and goal setting systems on github - 15 mins - COMPLETE

This gave me some inspiration for how to structure my own notes and goals.

3. Create my own file system, fill with the relevant links, and start putting on some content and details about my current knowledge and skills, my aims, and steps to reach them - 40 mins - COMPLETE

I now feel more confident in my ability to take control of my own learning, as I put systems in place to track, record and plan my own learning journey.

# Day 4

I plan to improve my TDD skills

1. Take further notes on Test-Driven Development and upload on here - 20 mins - COMPLETE

This reinforced my knowledge and understanding of why we use TDD, and how to properly implement it.

2. Practice TDD in the creation of my boris-bikes app - 4 hours - COMPLETE

Me and my partner were stuck on a particular problem for over an hour, this required us to really dig deep and deepen our knowledge of how RSPEC works.

2. Explain a TDD concept to someone with more experience than me - 10 mins

I successfully explained to my coach the TDD, feature and unit test work flow/cycle. I will take this as a good sign!

3. Watch a video of someone doing TDD, can I follow the skill - 20 mins - INCOMPLETE
