# Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
This week I have to learn how to test-drive a simple program.<br />
I have started on this during the Boris-bikes challenge.<br />
I had to use TDD to develop the objects:
- Person
- Bike
- DockingStation

These had to include methods such as:
- .working?
- .release
- .dock_bike

## I need to deepen my understanding of TDD.<br />

In order to do this I will:
1. Start with this [exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md)
2. Rubber duck my code so far on Boris bikes.
3. Then try and explain it to a senior or coach and ask for feedback.
