# Advice to my Younger Self from a Tech Lead

## The golden rule

These should be your priorities in order:

1. Correct
2. Clear
3. Fast

# Optimisation loop
Write code clear and simple,
fast enough for the business.

If it is not fast enough:

1. Find the bottleneck

2. Then fix it

3. Repeat until fast enough

Do not optimise at the beginning, wait until the business requires it.

## 10 second rule

Make code exruciatingly obvious.
It should take 10 seconds to read and understand a method
or else it can be made simpler.

## Libraries

Don't build libraries if you are employed by a business to solve a problem. Solve the problem and use other peoples libraries.

### Time
Time is hard - use Libraries

### Money
Money will have rounding erros, use a money library

### Threads
Threads are hard, use a library.

### Logging
Loggin is hard, use a library.

### Parsing
Parsing is tedious, use a library.
Use a standard data format that a library can parse.

----------------------------------
Your focus should be on solving the business problem.
