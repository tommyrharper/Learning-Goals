In traditional learning, a teacher transmits the learning to you.

However it is a lot more productive to think of learning that is produced and directed by the learner themselves.

In SLL you are responsible for how much is enough.

Whereas in TL you just did what you needed to pass the test or to complete the homework.

So it is important to decide what exercises are important to you.

If you are facing something that you've havent seen before this can create a lot of stress and anxiety.

Self led learning is about autonomy for the learner.

You ask, what do I need?
Look at where you have got to on a daily basis, and create a really fast feedback loop.
Did I understand this, yes or no?

In TL you just go with the flow, in SLL you need to forge your own path.

TL is about passing the exam. Whereas in this setting, there's no way you could prepare for the job fully, you will have to learn on the job.

If you have just followed TL you haven't practiced teaching yourself to learn.

You will need learn for the rest of your career. You keep relearning and relearning again and again.

Break down the work as much as possible. You need to have some goal, to move towards and to be able to break it down.

If you think too far ahead it is overwhelming.
If you have a big goal, break it down into sub goals.

Start by building something very small. In a new environment start spiking. What can you learn by just doing, rather than diving into the reading?

Get blocked by things, which will drive your googling to unblock something.

There is the breakable toy approach, where you build a play thing.

So rather than my goal is get a job as a web developer, say I am going to build the best toDo list app ever, or a social media application.

Then choose some technologies and go for it!

If you hit a brick wall, try and abstract it. One layer up what I am trying to accomplish, is another route there? Can I approach this in another way?

If you realise it is not a thing you can do in this framework, or this tool, then you have found it is not actually possible with this technology. Take a step back.

Also there may be something about how you phrasing the problem, or thinking about the challenge that is causing you hitting the brick wall. So you need to take a step back.

So maybe you are asking completely the wrong question. How do I do something differently. Step away from the laptop.

-------

Reflect on what you have learnt regularly, and set yourself small goals based on a bigger goal you have set for yourself.

## Rule

Never spend more than 20 minutes on a problem.
Question to use - what am I actually doing to try and solve this problem? Then write it down. Work out what your approach is.
Am I looking at the error message properly? Have I understood that.

Have I followed a reasonable debugging process.

Junior devs often avoid asking senior devs questions becuase they want to prove themselves, which often is counter productive.

# On doing what excites you

Start with what excites you. This works in an industry that is future facing. It will feed into the real work application. For example some industries have a bias to a certain technology. E.g. large compaines like Java, there are emerging technologies in start ups. E.g. in the charity sector, you may have to learn PHP.

Working on what excites you may well be the thing that sets you apart in the job market. Not every new dev will have spent that time in there, so it can help to set you apart.

It is obvious when someone is sincere or cares about something. An employer could ask, show me something you are proud of. There is also something to be said for playing the game, don't dwell on trendy technologies or get too focused on one thing. Check out the shiny tool so you can say you have some understanding or some experience with it. Both things can be true regarding this question of passion vs the job market.

## Summary


1. Set a goal on something you would like to make. 
2. Break it down into tiny small goals.
3. Reflect often on how you progressing.
