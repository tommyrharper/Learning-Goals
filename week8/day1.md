# Day 1

Today was tough. I broke. Crap. Burnout. Rest recoup, and I'll come back stronger tomorrow.

I still learnt a lot about ruby on rails, and I led my team reasonably well, though I think my low energy levels showed.

I didn't sign up for review. I didn't meet my goals for today. Lets try again tomorrow and hope it goes well.
