# Day 4

Today our leader overslept and so we had another person set up/be forced to become leader as I seem to be the only person who likes to be leader. That is totally weird because being leader is the most fun position so I don't know why people don't want to be leader, but hey.

Then me, Faye and Ed hooked up Travis-CI to heroku to implement continuous deployment which is super awesome and amazing! Now our project deploys to heroku every single push to the master branch.

There were various challenges we had to overcome, including messing up the master branch by an accidental push onto the master branch, and having to roll back and get that fixed. Then working out the correct configuration was difficult but we got there in the end, and worked out how to do it, and now have a document to refer to in the future.

I also know how to use Heroku to deploy now which is really useful.

Meanwhile, Harry and Angelica worked on getting our sign up and sign in branch merged, which turned out to take a lot more time than was expected. Our leader eventually turned up from his slumber, and decided to pass on leadership to the day to Faye.

Faye has been a good leader today and I am happy with her leadership.

I then went to the final projects fair and saw some really cool projects, including one that shows all the satellites travelling around the earth and can predict when they will burn up into space dust.

Harry, Angelica and Steven kept working hard trying to get it to work until our retro at 4pm, but it does not seem that they are going to get it done on time.
