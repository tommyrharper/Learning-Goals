# Day 3

Today was the final day in our sprint, and my last day as leader. I really enjoyed being leader and love this role, I feel it is my natural romping ground, I am in my element.

I worked with my pair partner on setting up simplecov so that it shows a nice table in the command line displaying test coverage when rspec is run.

Then we finished off a tutorial on creating a Rails blog which has given me a basic understanding of how it all works.

I had a real issue with my computer, a brew bug that was causing the program to fail when setting up the databse. I took a couple of hours to solve but eventually we got to the bottom of this.

Then we implemented Travis-CI and got that working after some kerfuffles. The time in particular was an issue, we had to set Travis time to match GMT for our tests to work, a simple solution in the end, but took a while to find the exact line of code needed to make it work.

Then we had a talk on [self led learning](./self_led_learning.md). This was informative and inpsiring and has given me lots of ideas on how to hone my self led learning process.

We refactored some of the code, reviewed some code and merged it all just in time for the retro.

We had an end of sprint retro, which was really amazing and I loved it. We found lots of useful ways to improve, and our coach pointed out that we could have taken more from the things that went well and maybe a point of ensuring those things continued.

We merged a final branch, and the only branch that is not fully merged was the sign in and sign out one, we will do that tomorrow, and do a demo.

I just did a pairing session with my mentor, and he was not really ready and so spent a long time setting up his repository, so maybe we can complete it another time.
