- Easier to iterate/change a model
- Easier to add detail
- Its a great way to communicate and discuss a process with another person.
- Reduces the amount you have to store in your short term memory.

## It can take several forms

- A boxes and arrows diagram e.g. [diagram codes](diagram.codes/d/sequence)
- An interpretive dance
- A performance where each person is 
- A form of your own invention
