# Day 4

Second last day of Makers Academy. What a ride, what a journey, it's been incredible, I've absolutely loved it, and I am happy with the product we have produced.

We fixed some final few bugs today, sured up the visuals on the design, and began preparing our presentation, our final one, which we will share with the cohorts on Friday tomorrow.

Overall I have fallen in love with code and am passionate about life as a whole. Lets keep going and smash it, and give everything we've got.

Brilliant day, loved it, and learnt lots.
