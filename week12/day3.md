# Day 3

This was feature freeze day of final projects, any we features we didn't finish today will not be in the project.

Fear not however, through determination, effort and focus our team has pulled through, showed up and delivered all the main features we wanted in time! Yes.

Today I worked on so many differnt things I cannot even count them, countless different bugs have been removed, tests added, features added, code refactored, and so and so forth.

I have even master mocking in testing to a whole new level now. So I have been learning lots too. My overall command of react.js and javascript has improved notably, and I now feel immenseley confident and event fluent writing code react.

It is an amazing feeling of flow when when I am absorbed in solving a problem where my level of comprehension has gone beyond just mere understanding to knowing and I can channel that knowledge straight from my brain, onto the keyboard and into the computer, creating a working program that solves a real world problem.

That is powerful, and that is why I love programming, I can wire my brain into the machine, and let the machine solve a problem I have solved only once, a potentially infinite number of times.

That is liberation from the physical, mundane and repetitive tasks of life, computer science and engineering has the potential liberate mankind from laborious, boring and mundane physical and intellectual task and free us to live and breathe in a higher level of creativity, which is far more rewarding and fulfilling for the human soul.

Thank god for computers.
