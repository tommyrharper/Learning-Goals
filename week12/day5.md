# Final day of Makers

Today I prepared for my group presentation this evening, and generally just had a lot of fun messing around and playing games with the cohort.

We had a big retro, and overall this has been a super awesome amazing journey and I have really loved it loads and loads and loads.

This is just the beginning, all endings are also beginnings, and I look forward to venturing into my exciting career as a developer.

I have fallen in love with code, and am making it my craft, my labour of love.

In this way, I can contribute to the world.

Not just with the software that I produce, but with my energy, enthusiasm, excitement, passion, dedication, devotion and love.

Thank you Makers for an amazing journey, love from Tom.
