A bit about you.
Your background, ambitions, motivations.

You will come into a face to face zoom call with three people, Edward and two engineers, something and Magnus.

## Extra info

There are times when you have to work a bit late. A lot of customers are in the USA.

It's on you to schedule your day and make sure you are not overworking yourself.
Edwardo the manager is very much aware of that scenario.
They are hiring because they are busy.
If a customer wants to meet up for 9pm at night, you have to let them know that is not when you are available.

Throughout the whole of Tray, you are given a lot of autonomy.
You are expected to be present for meets.
No one will tell you how to manage your day.
One of our colleagues JB, he really likes to work late at night, he will strut into the office at midday, 2pm, then he will work through the night.
They will enable you to do that.
As long as the work is being done, you are present for meetings where you are needed, you are free to work as you see fit.

Favourite thing about working at Tray is the people, it's such a great group of people, I think the leadership really does care about you. A genuine feeling of care. Work really hard to make it a diverse culture at tray. There is a trainbow group LGBT. 

Chimdi Ike first met with Tray when he was working at an agency. Servant leadership.
