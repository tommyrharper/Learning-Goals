# Day 3

Today we had our group check in with EÃ³in, this weeks coach.

He asked each of us how we were getting on with our learning.


Responding to him made me realise how positive I feel about my learning journey at Makers.

Reaons why it is going so well:

- I am falling in love with the process.
- I relish getting stuck! - This is so important, everytime you get stuck, you have hit the opportunity to really learn something new.
- My home is the unknown! I have made my home the uncomfortable sticky world of what I don't know. Everyday I take the leap the faith into the unknown, and expand my comfort zone each day. By the end of each day, I have learnt something new! Often many different things.
- I love being a part of a team. I get massive energy from interacting with other people, so being a part of a team of highly motivated individuals is super charging me to the next level.
- I am optimising my whole life, in and outside of the course - you can't separate your home and work life - especially in this time of Covid-19 induced isolation! We are literally living where we work. I am deeply passionate about optimising my whole life, which means intense discipline, daily meditation, working out, a strict sleep routine, journalling, stretching, reading and studying self-development materials. This feeds into my performance on the course, as I bring an energy of confidence, motivation, positivity, lovem passion and joy. This is my very life energy myself, I have discovered an infinite source of peace, love, joy, passion and motivation from within myself.

# Team Sataa

My coding team is called team Sataa.

Today I was tasked to team up with Alexa, and figure how to connect to and use a Postgresql database via Node.js.

We worked super well, I was driving and Alexa was navigating and we managed to get the code working together and learn something totally new.
