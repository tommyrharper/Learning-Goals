# Day 3

Today we had a workshop on Async and the event the loop.

I do not fully understand it and so need to put in more work there, but I have the general idea that it is to do with the timing and queing of functions in javascript. I will delve deeper into this subject to come to a fuller understanding.

Then after lunch I was working with my team on our notebook application.

We decided to split into two groups, one implementing a new feature on the app, and the other updating our testing framework.

I was on the testing framework team, our framework is called Watermelon.

We moved watermelon up from watermelon1.0 to watermelon2.0.

Watermelon2.0 is largely inspired by jasmine, but we developed it ourselves.

It works in the console, rather than updating the actual html page.

We had use functions within functions and object literals to make this work which was interesting.

Later today I will be going to an intro to Machine Learning.

I am interested in machine learning as a potential career route.

Then after that I will attend a meetup group focused on product engineering.
