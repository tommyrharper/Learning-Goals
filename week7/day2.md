# Day 2

Today was another full and intense day with lots of learning involved.

Today I really worked on communicating better with my teammates. I made sure to find out how everyone was feeling, what their motivations were for the day, and to recieve from and give feedback to everyone on the team.

This really paid off in terms of improving the harmony within the team. We worked much better today than yesterday.

I also had a proccess workshop review with one my coaches, where I was reminded of and went more indepth into some the higher level concepts of TDD. You can say my process notes in reference to that.

I accidently missed a workshop on building a test suite - I was too deep in my code - oops! I will have to catchup on everything I missed, I will try and find somebody to pair with that on tomorrow.

I also had a chat with Dana about communication and team work skills. You can find the notes from that in this folder.
