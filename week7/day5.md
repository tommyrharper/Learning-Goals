# Day 5

I started the day trying to understand what an [object literal](./object_literals.md) is.

Then I spent the next few hours working on hooking our notebook up to a vanilla javascript API that I built. This really deepend my knowledge and understanding of APIs.

However when it came time to join with team, one of my team members didn't really like the fact that I had done all this code and majorly changed the project on my own. I anticipated this, however it was important for me to learn how that worked so I did it anyway, this is learning journey afterall. So we didn't merge my changes which was a shame as it improved the functionality of the app considerably and removed some bugs, but it wasn't worth it for upsetting my team mate.

Then we had group reflection, and then we finished today a bit early, around 5pm.
