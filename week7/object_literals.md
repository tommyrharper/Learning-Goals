# Object literals explained

```
let obj1 = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
}

let obj2 = new Object()
obj2.prop1 = "val1"
obj2.prop2 = "val2"

arr1 = ["hello", 33, 55]

arr2 = new Array()
arr2.push("hello")

obj1 is an object literal
obj2 is an object

arr1 is an array literal
arr2 is an array

The literal is to do with how you write it.
