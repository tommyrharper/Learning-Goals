# Day 4

Today was an intense and full on day.

I started the day after my group check-in and goal settings with a live code workshop.

You can find my extensive notes on this [here](./live_code.md)

Then I spent some time working on understanding event loops. You can see my notes [here](./event_loops.md).

I also went through theses two resources:

1. On [closures](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q)
2. Reading beyond my [level](https://hackmd.io/F-pmnp3hRhePddmf3mnKGw)

Then we worked in a group and I set up a node [server](./setting_up_node_server.md). Then I worked on hooking up the server as an API. This is not complete and I am still researching it.

I spent a couple of hours teaching my mentee TDD and how to set up his IDE ideally.

Then I spent the evening doing some further research.
