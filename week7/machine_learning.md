# Machine Learning

We had a machine learning expert come in and teach us about her work, and machine learning.

She had a PHd and works for a company called Force Point.

## What is Machine Learning?

 - Getting computers to act without being explicity programmed
 - Using data to discover the rules behind a problem

ML converts data to useful information.

- Computer systems that automatically improve with experience.
- Computer systems based upon the fundamental laws of learning
- It is a science
- You train a computer to act and behave like you
- For that you need continuous learning
- For that you need data

It is science, data and learning

## ML Applications

- Reccomendations eg. Amazon
- Self driving cars
- Predictingwhen patients get sick
- Stoping phising emails
- Photo categorization

## Aproaches

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

### Supervised learning

Learns by example, give exapmles and the the ML algorithm finds common and different features.

E.g. photos of oranges and photos of apples.

Orange -------> Apple

Orange | Color | Red
-------|-------|---
rough | texture | smooth
orange | inside | white

These inputs create a model which can tell if a photo is of an apple or an orange.

### Unsupervised learning

This works the same as the above, accept you don't the computer if it is an apple or an orange, it works it out by finding its own patterns of differences and commanilities, and groups pictures into group1 and group2 by its own deductions

### Reinforcement learning

This is done like training a dog. You tell the computer whether is has got it right or wrong and it adapts to get it right as much as possible.

## Process of ML

Data collection -> Data preparation -> Training -> Evaluation -> Tuning

70-80% of time is spent ond data collection and preparation.

## Evaluation

### Confusion Matrix

| |          | Actual|   |
|-|----------|----------|----------|
||          | Positive | Negative |
|Preditcted| Positive | true pos | false pos|
|| Negative | false neg| true neg |

Accuracy = (true positive + true negative)/(pos + neg)

F1 = (2*true pos)/((2*true pos) + false pos + false neg)

F1 is a better measure of the quality of the ML system in question

## Story telling

It is imporant that you present the data in a clear way that tells a powerful story so it actually has an impact

## How to get into ML

Follow the course of Andrew NG

Find data, listen to lectures, and apply the algorithms you have learnt.

## AI, ML, DL

AI is the root, the mother of all

ML is a subsection of AI

DL is a subsection of ML.
