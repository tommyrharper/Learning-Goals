# Day 1

Today we worked in groups on building a Notebook application in vanilla javascript.

I enjoyed building our own testing framework, that helped me to understand on a deeper level how testing really works.

When we worked on a team some issues came up about moving too fast, and I had to practice my communication skills with the other team mates.

I was happy that I feel we managed to work things and and I hope that will pay off tomorrow when we join forces again.

I am really enjoying the course right now and learning a lot.

I also tackled a kata in javascript in a process workshop, that helped my confidence as I felt much more fluid and confident in javascript this time around.

I will send my recording of that process workshop to a coach and get feedback tomorrow.

I also talked to a coach and went over a code review of my weekend work, and found lots of areas where I can improve which is really useful. I should update that code while it is still fresh in my memory.

## To do
