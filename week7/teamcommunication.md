# Team communication skills

## Self Celebration

Remember to congratulate yourself for being you. Celebrate yourself, that is pure positivity. Celebrate your very own being. That is at the very core of what makes Dana our cheif Joy Officer such an inspiration to us all. She celebrates her own being, and encourages us to do the same.

## How to Check in

I am not checking in on others to parent or rescue, but rather in order to optimise my behaviour depending on what will be most functional in conjuction with them.

If they have a problem or are upset, offer no solution, just listen.

## Self Disclosure

Let everyone know if I am working on something at the momemnt personally, let them know if I am aggresive and like to drive, and that I may seize control at points to smash out the code when I see the solution, and that I am working on that.

## Extra daily check in

Can schedule an extra daily check in with everyone.

## Feedback

Ask everyone for feedback, how was I today?

## Motivations
