- Benefit to Company

Finish with benefit this will bring to the company.

e.g. 
During my Makers I was successfully able to pair with my team mates in a high pressure situation.
And therefore I was able to get a sucessful result improving the efficiency of my project.
I will therefore be able to do this when I am in a high pressure situation.

Soft skill:
Communication, team work, emotional intelligence, leadership
Take that soft skill and put it into an example.

During makers I was able to pair with multiple different people. This required me to be able to communicate effectively. Due to my brokering background I am used to interacting with multiple people. This allowed me to excel when I came to Makers where I had to communicate with multiple individuals. Because I am able to communicate effictively in multiple scenarios, I would be a good fit for dealing with challenging customers.
