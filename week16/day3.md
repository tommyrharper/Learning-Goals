# Day 3

Today I:

- Rose at 4am.
- 1 hours meditation
- Managed to get three hours of coding in before peer group check-in at 9am.
- Created from scratch a brand new Portofio that is far superior to my previous one. One I would now be happy showing to employers.
- Deployed the new Portfolio to my personal url.
- Attended peer group check in.
- Attended group workshop on interviews.
- Practiced interview questions.
- Created a brand new CV with vastly superior aesthetics. Fundamentally rethought out the way I present myself and created a CV that is 10x more convincing.
- Spent 5 hours of deep unwavering focus perfecting this CV. Super happy with my insane level of productivity today. Absolutely smashed it.
