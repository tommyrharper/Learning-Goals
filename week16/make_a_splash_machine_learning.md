## Pragmatic Pet Projects

- Solves an immediate problem (your problem)
- Zero priority == Zero risk if undelivered, zero stress, focus on just playing around and learning
- Problem you have indentified (you take full ownership)

Watch out when you join the company because you have the unique perspective where you are not blind to everything.
You can see th tedious or potentially error prone processes that everyone else is used to.

## Read these books

## Ideas

- Make some data/information more accessible using an interanlly accessible website.
- Automating a routine tedious multi-page process using a framework like Selenium and CRON jobs.
- Data entry

## Tools for pragmatic pet projects

- Google Apps Script --> Connects across all of googles products.
- AutoML Tables --> Google docs Machine Learning!

## Questions

Good place to start for ML:

Deploying models:

- Google AI-Platform

How to attack an ML problem

1. Start with APIs, see if they solve it for you.
2. If it is common problem like image or text recognition, use AutoML or something and they will solve it.
3. If it is a more complex/unique problem, then go to TensorFlow and make your own model.

Supervised learning is better/more accurate. Unsupervised learning is difficult unless you have a lot of data and computer power.
