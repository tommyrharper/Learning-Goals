# Day 1

Final projects begin today!

See the github page from makers academy [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/final_projects).

Also see the [pracitce project resource](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/practice_project_week).

We decided to call our team 'Mission Ctrl' and create a shortcut training game.

We set our group charter, and made our plan, and got to work learning React.js that we will use for our project.

Then we finished with a retro.
