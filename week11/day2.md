# Day 2

Today I was leading the final day of our sprint.

I finished off teaching two of the team members react.js, this took until lunch time.

Then I had some correspondence with my mentees. I will be meeting one of them via zoom tomorrow at 12pm.

Then we delegated work after lunch time, and I worked with Alex creating the very start of our react application.

We got super stuck on the testing and it was driving me crazy, but eventually we got to the root of it and it was all solved.

Then we spent some time in TDD driving the creation of the start of our brilliant application.

We got a significant bit of work done, all in time for our evening demo and retrospective.
