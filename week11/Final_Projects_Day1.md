# Final Projects Day 1

It doesn't have to be the idea you are super passionate about, it is okay to just like it.

Good distribution of work is important. Make sure everyone feels like they are contributing equally. Each member of the team should be able to explain the application works the way it works and how it works.

Keep a really nice readme.

Keep a record of your learning process.

You can do whatever you want, it's entirely up to you.

Can use the [project design workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/practice_project_week/project_design_workshop.md) to help plan your project.

Remember the [XP Values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html).

Will be running 2 day sprints. After next wednesday no new features can be added.

Standup every morning. Sometimes second standup each afternoon.

Retro every evening. If things are not going as well as they could think about why. Is it the team dynamic? Is it the idea?

Share individual motivations in the team.

Then decide when will you have standups and retros, but also make a team charter to help decide what kind of culture do you want.

eg.
```
What does a good team look like?
What do we expect from each other?
How do we go about leanring a new tool?
What is our working time commitment?
What meetings will we have?
How will we delegate work?
How will we knowledge-share?
How will we make decisions?
How will we track and report progress?
How will we celebrate success?
How will we hld ourselves to this charter?
What will we do if we notice someone isn't upholding what's written in this charter?
```
