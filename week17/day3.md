# Day 3

Today I:

- Chilled out and recovered from family therapy.
- Meditated by the river for 1.5 hours.
- Went for a walk with my sister.
- Had a long chat with my sister and my mum.
- Went for a walk with my friend Alfie.
- Had a chat on the phone with my friend Ben.
- Had a chat on the phone with my friend Affan.
- Feel much better and rejuvinated now after the family therapy related freak out.
- Now feel ready to attack the job search again tomorrow with renewed vigour and strength.
