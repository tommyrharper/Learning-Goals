# Day 4

Today I spent all day working on react. That was awesome, I now feel confident that I can work with react.

We managed to hook up the rails API to our react.js front end and it actually works!

Waheeyy!! Amazing, so happy about that, I feel incredible. That is just lovely juvely it is.

Bloody fantastic.

We also had a [career design workshop](./career_design.md). You can see my notes by clicking on the link.
