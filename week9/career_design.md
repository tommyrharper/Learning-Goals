1. I remember when I was searching for a job as my home wasn't a safe place to be anymore and I needed to make some money to find independence for my own safety, I had just got back from living at the monastery and my mother and father were divorcing after he had had an affair, which would end up with us potentially on the street.

It was difficult situation to be, but I set myself moving forward determined to come to a solution, to find some honest work and get to it. I kept finding myself in recruitment agencies, and I noticed two things, software engineers have higher pay and better job satisfaction that a lot of the roles I was going for. I had a place on some virtual reality courses across the UK at university and knew I would have to do some coding to complete it.

Two of my friends had been to Makers Academy and were making successfull careers out of it. I thought maybe I could give it a shot, even if just to prep myself for the course. I visited and got pulled into the vibe. Before I knew it, here I am, coding away furiously every single day.

2. Tech makes decentralised networks possible, financial and business systems that run themselves autonomously outside of the control of any bank or government, running themselves on servers around the world, this is transforming the structure of financial and economic systems around the world, and is opening up the potential for an era of increased equality of opportunity, transparency, security and global connectivity. This is the blockchain. Artificial intelligence is now making it possible for self driving cars.

3. Wirex, Revolut, Coinbase, Monzo, Tide.

5. This career change is really about looking after my myself and my family.
