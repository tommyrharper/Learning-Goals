# Day 1

Today I spent learning react.js with two other people on my team.

We had a sudden requirement to change the functionality of our application to a back-end api for rails, meaning we had to take the back-end off rails, change rails into an API that sends JSON objects and begin building a single page application with rails.

We have not begun building the SPA yet, we have just been studying and researching and playing around with react.js to learn how it works.
