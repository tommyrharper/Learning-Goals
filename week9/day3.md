# Day 3

Today we started a new sprint. I was assigned to the react team again with Harry.

This was awesome.

Harry is amazing. I learnt so much and made code that for the first time I was proud of.

It combined react.js, asynch, mocks and asynch testing all in one finely tuned package of coding beauty.

I loved it, what a fantatic day, with lots learnt, and much acheived, I feel happy and content after a hard days enjoyable work deep in the world of code.
