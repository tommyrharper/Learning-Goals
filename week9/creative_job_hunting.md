DONT SEND OUT BLANKET CVS! Look at the job, look at the keywords they are looking for, and put them in your CV! Make sure the application is extremely suited to that roll.

Choose rolls you give a shit about. Be prepared, research the company first. Do your homework, he did 6 30 minute usability tests on the companies product before showing up to the interview. Over prepare.

Barriers forced him to be creative.

Creativity came from trying lots of things.

From failing a lot.

## Disclaimer to being a founder/employee

These days there is a lot of hype about being a founder.

There are pros/cons to both.

Being a founder, it is much harder to have work life balance.

What outcome do you want?

In larger companies you can become more specialised. As a founder you have to do a bit of everything.
