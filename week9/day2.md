# Day 2

After starting with a scrum meeting, my group finished off the react.js tutorial.

Then we built a thermostat app using react.js and made a fake API and hooked that up.

Then we went on to start building the real thing for our project.

We were stuck on testing for a while, but managed to use the react testing suite and enzyme to successfully test our code.

Then we had the team retro, code demo and assigned a new leader for the next sprint.
